The job requires someone who is skilled with customizing a design,  who  can help develop my vision, has their own sense of design but can \"get\" mine, and who also had organizational and content management skills so we can think through  how to best organize/display the content on my site. Mostly the design is about the homepage. The other \npages simply involve written articles of mine with the exception of 5 pages eg \"In the Media\" which would showcase various clips of quotes from magazines, newspapers and some video, a humor page with cartoons, and google reviews - I would need help with design ideas for how to display and lay out these pages.  I do not particularly love  the look/design of most people's websites  and want to love mine. I can show you some images and designs that are consistent with my taste so you can extrapolate. I also have a specific design idea but then need help with the rest. \nExamples of website design styles I like:  \n﻿ ﻿﻿https://www.thecraftsmen.tech/   (I like the colors and shapes)\n ﻿https://www.mubasic.com/ https://weltio.com/   (I like the color contrast of bright green and purple on black)\n https://project-holi.org/2   (I like the font and boldness) \nhttps://altsdigital.com/ (Cool and interesting, but too playful and too much movement for my site) https://huyml.co/    (I just think his illustrations, etc are way cool. But not relevant really.) https://barnhouse.com/ (I like the idea of big circles but they would have to be in a context of boldness and like the spotlight idea - That's partly why I like rollover buttons.) https://dribbble.com/shots/20994308-HIREMIND-Job-Seeker-Website ( I like the colors, contrasts, shapes, clean sharp look) https://dribbble.com/shots/20929286-Work-Connect-JobFinder( I like the edges, shapes (except the uneven one), colors, font, color contrasts) https://dribbble.com/shots/19555664-Morski-Job-Finder ( I like the colors, contrast, clean look) https://dribbble.com/shots/20638389-Job-Finder-Application ( I like the colors, contrast, and large shapes and their lineup)\n https://www.mijkecoebergh.nl/ (I like a few of the images including the black girls with braid, couple walking, and I like the light bulb icon to use maybe for my site) https://www.saaa.am/ ( I like the shapes and this is very cool - too advanced for my website but I like the bold shapes, colors and ideas)",

Ideally, any changes we may make to the add-in should automatically be deployed to users. Will need your advice / instructions how to best deploy to users.\nUsers use PC and Mac.

I want to develop a margin trading enabled cryptocurrency exchange that has a design similar to the Korean exchange \"upbit.com\". Additionally, the exchange should use KRW instead of USD.\nThe following is the layout of the exchange:\n- Exchange layout : Main page, Exchange, Deposit/Withdrawal, Investment history, Customer center, Login\nThe main page should be developed with a similar layout as Upbit.\n- Spot trading layout : Chart, Order Book, Trades, Coin list, Order Window (Market Buy/Sell, Limit Buy/Sell, Fees), Execution history.\n- Margin trading layout : Chart, Order Book, Trades, Coin list, Order Window (Cross - Market/Limit, Isolated - Market/Limit/Leverage, Fees), Execution history.\n- Deposit and Withdrawal : Refer to the Deposit and Withdrawal screenshot.\n- Investment History : Refer to the Investment History screenshot.\n- Customer center : Refer to the Customer Center screenshot.\n- Login : Find ID, Reset Password.\n- Sign up : Refer to the Sign up screenshot.\nThe following is the list of exchange features\n- Margin trading feature : The chart should display my positions. Margin should be adjustable and there should be a forced liquidation feature. Detailed information should be displayed in the execution history.\n1. Order management system (OMS) : for handling order processing and managing the order book for derivative products.\n2. Matching engine : responsible for matching buy and sell orders and executing trades in real-time.\n3. Risk management system : for calculating and managing the risk of derivative products, including margin requirements, collateral management, and position limits.\n4. Settlement and clearing : for handling the settlement and clearing of trades, including the movement of funds and assets between counterparties.\n5. Reporting and analytics : for providing reporting and analytics tools to help traders and risk managers monitor and analyze their positions and performance.\n6. User interface : for providing traders with a user-friendly interface to access the exchange, view market data, and place orders.\n7. API and connectivity : for providing APIs and connectivity options to enable third-party applications and traders to access the exchange's functionality and data.\n8. Spot trading feature: Detailed information should be displayed in the execution history.\n- Swap feature : Fast trading function is required.\n- Referral functionality :\n% on the difference between deposit and withdrawal. ex) Assuming the referral fee is 1%, if a user deposits $1000 and withdraws $400, the referring user (distributor) receives 1% profit on the difference between the deposit and withdrawal ($600), i.e. $6 profit.\non transaction fees. ex) Assuming the basic trading fee for spot trading is 2%, and the referral fee for trading fee is 2%, if you buy/sell $1000, the basic fee (exchange manager revenue) is $20, and the referring user (distributor) earns $0.4.\nIf you make x100 margin trades, the commission is 2% of $100,000. The commission rate should be adjustable from the admin page.\n- I need an admin page.\n- Develop a volume bot (upbit API) : The volume bot should be used to fetch the market price using the upbit API. The volume bot should also continue to work to increase the volume, and the amount of volume should be adjustable from the admin page.\n- Deposit/Withdrawal feature: I'm thinking that the admin should be able to provide the account number when the customer asks for it in the customer center.\n- Charts: We should use the upbit API to import upbit charts as they are.\n- Localization feature: should be localizable to English\nBelow is a list of features for the admin page of the exchange.\n- Dashboard\n- User page\n- Coins\n- Admin page\n- Deposit/Withdrawal admin page\n- Settings\n- Landing settings: You should be able to add, edit, and delete banners, images, and posts on your exchange.",

Main focus currently is on an AI-based Patent Application platform.\nA typical patent applications has multiple sections of Text contents (called Specifications), with each section having its own ML Model and requirements, to products a specific “language” and “Format” output.\nEach model will have as input a series of Keywords and statements manually entered by the user. The output for each ML will be one or more paragraphs with very specific format and language pertaining to that’s section of the patent application.\nMy current developer has already completed the first 3 ML Models (Abstract, Field Summary and Prior Arts) and they look fairly good.\nNext, ML#4, I need a model for Detail Specification of drawings in the patent.\nUser manually creates a .DOC document of their drawing Figures (Sheets or pages). There are typically 10 to 50 drawing sheets per application. Each sheet has multiple images and elements (2D shapes like Boxes) in it. Each Image or element has a) an Element Number, b) a Title and c) some Description (one or more keywords or sentences) I need the ML to take user inputs, and optimize the “Description” section (correct English, Spelling, Grammar) and add some very related contents to complete a paragraph on each element. ML CANNOT change any of the Element Numbers OR add contents not specifically related to user inputs, this is critical here.\n \nFollowing above ML, I would need ML#5, I will need a model for CLAIMS section, to again take user inputs and create output with specific format of the Claim requirements.\n \nI am, looking for an expert in this field, not needing much learning curve as I am already late on this project and have a few other ones waiting in the pipeline. I can pay $300 for each working model of this project. Looking for a long-term relationship to add a good AI talent to my current developer team.\n \nThanks\n David\ndnosrati@aol.com\n ",

        "JobDescription": "Important: Read entire job listing. Do not apply without answering the questions below. Any applications not including answers to the questions below are ignored and immediately deleted.\nGreetings! I'm looking for a developer to help with building our ERP system. We have several modules that still need help with building out: \n1. Improving our keyword research tool (module) \n2. Advertising module (track clicks / impressions / integrate uploading videos & images) [New module that needs to be built out]\n3. Google Docs workspace plugin \n- all kinds of other help is needed! \nNote: The keyword research tool mentioned above is not a search plugin that searches a user’s own website for something. It's a keyword tool that will be implemented into our SAAS, see this site as an example that helps users find great keywords to target: www.keywordsheeter.com  \nIt would be nice if it found keywords and included their respective monthly search volume. It'll need to be integrated into our SAAS that we're in the middle of building (ongoing work that you can help with if you're interested). \n***My budget is $400/month, ongoing.*** I cannot increase it at this time. However, I will increase your monthly amount as more subscribers sign up to use it. Do not apply if you need more than $400 per month right now as you'll be wasting your time and mine.\nOur SAAS is built on Node.js (backend) and angular 13 (frontend). \nPlease answer the questions when you apply and rate yourself from 1-10 (10=best) on each:\n1. Node.js (express) (v.14+)\n2. PrimeFaces / PrimeNG\n3. Angular 13 \n4. Typescript\n5. I have one other developer working full time on this project, how well do you work with others? \n6. What does success mean to you and how would you make this project a success? \n7. If hired, when could you start? \n8. Have you built anything like this before? \n9. Why are you interested in this job/project? \n10. How many & what other projects are you currently working on? \n11. Do you work with a team, agency, or as an individual? \n12. Why should I choose you? \n13. How can you make it better or different than keywords research tools already out there? \n14. How long will it take? \n15. If this turns out well and we enjoy working together, would you like to continue helping with our project? \n16. How many hours per week can you put in? \n17. What are your week/weekends like? \n18. Web scripts\n19. Building & Integrating API’s\n20. AI & ChatGPT experience \n21. WordPress\nFinal questions:  \nTyping - please take this typing test and include a screenshot of your results with your past writing examples. https://10fastfingers.com/typing-test/english\nDo you have any experience related to SEO or Keyword Research? Can you tell me more about that or show me related projects you've worked on? \nWhat other skills do you have that could help with this project? \nPlease remember to include any project links like this or otherwise you've built in the past. (ERP / SAAS / Websites etc...)\nI am ready to hire and would love to start right away. If you see this job listing then I am actively interviewing others, please do not skip the questions. Let's get started today! \nPlace \"Keyword Research Success\" in the first line of your response so I know you've read this.\nThank you! ",

        "JobDescription": "I have a AAA base multiplayer FPS game I want to make some initial modifications to that I just don't have the time to do. \nThe asset pack I'm using for the base game is: https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/fps-multiplayer-template-v-1 so should make a lot of this work pretty easy as it will be essentially just leveraging the pack to do the work. \nI have a lot / if not all the AAA assets needed for this but once this project starts they will be available.\nThis work will be done in stages which are listed below:\nI want to add a random AI boss that spawns in random locations around the map that drops a random item from a data set (4 to start). For this project it will drop a 1 of 4 random swords with varying drop chance. These swords will take the player into 3rd person mode when picked up and have a left mouse button skill with special effects and a right mouse button skill. Once the player dies the weapon drops and someone else can pick it up. If hired I will give exact details. This will require doing some animation i.e. using market place animations and modifying slightly. \nAdd a grab on to ledge and leap up animation and sill to the player movement so you can hang on ledges, grab on to ledges move side to side and get up or drop down from the ledge.\nI want to display the enemies names above their heads in team modes and change color based on what team they are on.\nI want to add an additional game mode, the template pack I'm using has built in game mode creator where 1 person is a enemy boss and the rest of the players are against the boss. The boss should have skill for left mouse button right mouse button and 1-4 and be hard to kill so all the players have to work together to kill the boss. \nWork on animations making them more fluid.\nAdd more weapons / guns I'll provide the assets. I can adjust the settings just need the work done to add them.\nBeyond this it will be UI changes, hud changes, flow changes and most likely adding some type of registration system. I can do the backend easily in python so well have to discuss and work together on the best way to implement this.\nThis looks like a lot of work but realistically with the template pack I have now it is not very much I just work too many jobs and run a couple companies to do it my self. I need someone to help me flush out the grunt work and some of the basic stuff I just don't know how to do in UE5 because I'm used to Unity.\nThen if I like the work style I'll bring you on full time to help flush out the rest of the alpha.\n",

        "JobTitle": "SEEKING SOLUTION TO ART AUCTION SEARCH",
        "JobDescription": "SEEKING SOLUTION TO ART AUCTION SEARCH\n  \nOur mission is to search art auction catalogs for particular artists whose works may be coming for sale at auction. Undertaking the task manually would involve a large team of researchers which is both time consuming and not cost effective. \n \nThere has to be a way of automating this task, particularly with recent developments in A1 so that the entire process takes place in as short a time as possible, as new auctions are listed. We would then receive details of artworks coming to auction by the nominated artists.\n \nWe currently have a database of approximately 2,200 artists who we wish to check against upcoming auctions to see if their works are appearing.  The list will likely increase in size as we move forward.\n \nIn order to reduce this task to its simplest format we’ve given the matter a lot of thought, consulted and concluded that to be successful there are likely to be two components to accomplishing the goal of identifying the named artists – a combination of catalog scraping and AI.  I have described these below as Part 1 and Part 2.\n \nWe could try and search the entire internet in one sweep for all the named artists whose works are coming to auction but this is likely to be cumbersome, prone to error and expensive.  Hence the two pronged approach of Parts 1 and 2.  It may be that you can only provide Part 1 (the easier part) or Part 2 (bit more complex).  \n \nPlease quote for one or both parts as well as the ongoing provision of results.\n \nPART 1\n \nRather than starting out by trying to conquer the world we have decided to begin on a smaller scale – focusing on one or two countries before expanding to universal coverage.  We therefore propose to start with the UK and Ireland.  Then, once everything is working smoothly, start searching auctions in other countries such as the USA, Canada, Australia, etc.\n \nTo get started we are currently building a database of auction houses in the UK and Ireland.  It is 95% complete and currently numbers approximately 600 auction houses.  A partial list of the websites for these auction houses is available on request to give a general picture of what is involved.  Should you provide an initial quote and need to drill down into the data we can provide (in confidence) the complete database with all web addresses.\n \nJust listing the web addresses of the auction houses may not be sufficient and so we are also creating an ongoing database all the upcoming auctions at these auction houses.  Currently, this is a manual process but with developments in AI it may, in due course, be possible to pull all this data from the net and automate this process.  A list of all upcoming auctions is available on request as when we included them with this post, the post was rejected! The URL addresses should take you directly to auction pages.  In some cases the catalogs are not yet uploaded and this is shown. The list is being added to every day.\n \nRather than searching all the upcoming auctions for the individual named artists (2,200 and growing) we feel that the better solution is to search the auction sites for paintings, pictures, photographs and other designated artworks based on about 100 artistic search terms that are specific to the art industry. This should be a lot easier than finding the 2,200 artists direct from websites.  A list of search terms will be sent on request along with the other attachments.\n \nAny particular auction entry (lot) that carries one or more of these search terms would then be extracted and downloaded to a spreadsheet which will be continually updating itself.  On the spreadsheet will appear quite quickly many thousands of artists whose works are appearing in upcoming sales.\n \nOne suggestion as to how Part 1 (the extraction of data) takes place is that we use a web scraping tool to extract the auction data from each auction house website utilising AI-powered web scraping tools such as Scrapy, BeautifulSoup, or Selenium, which can automatically collect data from web pages and extract relevant information. There are no doubt other scraping tools also and you may have your own favourites.\n \nPART 2\n \nOnce all the relevant information is extracted from various auction pages there should be a spreadsheet listing thousands of paintings, prints, watercolours, photographs, etc, by various artists/photographers coming for auction.  Only a small number of these (well under 1%) will feature the artists in whom we are interested.  The information we would like to see in the spread sheet is;\n \nName of Auction House\nDate of Auction\nLot Number\nName of Artist\nTitle of Work\nMedium (ie oil, watercolour, photo, etc)\nURL to the lot\n \nAt this point we could find relevant artists by data matching our list to the downloaded data or by filtering.  It would be a reasonably quick process but not perfect. The other option is to have the names (and their variations) of all the artists we are searching to be pre-entered into some AI program and then simply apply that program to the downloaded list and immediately highlight or extract the relevant info.\n \nAmong the advice that has been given to us is that once the data is downloaded it should be possible to use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyse the data and identify works by specific artists.  It was further noted that NLP models such as Named Entity Recognition (NER) can be trained to recognise the names of artists and extract the data. You may have your own ideas on this.  \n \nFor what it is worth we were also advised that it might be possible to use a search engine to find specific artists directly from auction catalogues.  Here, such AI powered search engines as Algolia or Elastic Search have been mentioned because of their ability to search through large volumes of data quickly and efficiently.\n \nBut again, you may have your own ideas.\n \nIN SUMMARY\n \nWe are looking for a solution enabling us to search all art/antique auctions for works by named artists. Searches can be directly from the catalogue pages of auction houses or from aggregating websites such as The-Saleroom, EasyLiveAuction, Invaluable and LiveAuctioneers. Their URLs are available on request. We originally put them in this post but the post was rejected possibly because we’d included website addresses!\n \nI am looking for a proposal that meets our requirements (the initial cost) and is then supported by supplying the data  on an ongoing basis with regular emails  (for which there would clearly be a monthly charge). We do not want to run the application ourselves and wish to outsource the entire project.  We simply seek to receive the output on a regular basis.\nPlease message me to receive any lists referred to.",
